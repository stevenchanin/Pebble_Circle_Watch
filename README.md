# Pebble Circle Watch
Circular Geometric Watch Face for Pebble Watch

## Background
I had some time over Labor Day weekend and it seemed like it would be fun to try out the Pebble SDK.

Discussed design ideas with my wife and daughter over breakfast and decided to try an analog design that showed hours and minutes using concentric circles that filled in based on what time it was.
